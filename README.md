# **Robotics Path Planning Problem**

## **Overview**

Path planning is a critical problem in robotics,
where the objective is to determine a valid sequence of movements for a robot to
travel from a designated starting point to a goal location within a given
environment. The problem involves navigating through a grid or map with
obstacles, ensuring the path is both feasible and optimal. This problem is
fundamental in robotics, autonomous vehicles, logistics, and other domains
that require spatial navigation and
optimization.

## **Problem Statement**

Given a two-dimensional grid environment:

1. The grid is composed of **cells**, where each cell can be either:
   - **Free**: A cell that the robot can traverse.
   - **Blocked**: A cell that contains an obstacle, which the robot must avoid.
2. The robot is placed at a **start location** on the grid.
3. The robot must navigate to a designated **goal location**.

The challenge is to compute a **valid path** from the start location to the
goal location that satisfies the following
constraints:

1. The robot cannot pass through cells marked as obstacles.
2. The robot can only move to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, or
   diagonally, depending on the configuration).
3. The path should avoid revisiting cells unless necessary.

## **Inputs**

1. **Grid Map**: A representation of the environment as a matrix where:

   - `0` indicates a free cell.
   - `1` indicates a blocked cell (obstacle).  
     Example:

   ```text
   0 0 1 0 0
   0 1 1 0 0
   0 0 0 1 0
   1 1 0 1 0
   0 0 0 0 0
   ```

2. **Start Location**: The initial coordinates of the robot on the grid, e.g.,
   `(1, 1)`.
3. **Goal Location**: The destination coordinates the robot must reach, e.g.,
   `(5, 5)`.

## **Objectives**

1. **Feasibility**:

   - Ensure a valid path exists from the start to the goal.
   - If no valid path exists, indicate that the goal is unreachable.

2. **Optimality (optional)**:
   - Minimize the total distance traveled (shortest path).
   - Alternatively, optimize based on additional criteria like energy
     consumption or time.

---

## **Constraints**

1. **Obstacle Avoidance**: The robot must never enter a blocked cell.
2. **Grid Boundaries**: The robot must stay within the bounds of the grid.
3. **Sequential Movement**: The robot can only move to adjacent cells in a single
   time step.
4. **Dynamic Environment (Optional)**: If the obstacles or free cells can
   change over time, the solution must adapt dynamically.

---

## **Challenges**

1. **Complex Environments**:

   - Dense grids with many obstacles can make finding a valid path
     computationally intensive.
   - Narrow passages or mazes require precise pathfinding.

2. **Unreachable Goals**:

   - If the start and goal are separated by completely blocked areas, no valid
     path exists.
   - The algorithm must detect and report such cases efficiently.

3. **Multiple Objectives**:

   - Balancing feasibility with optimality, especially in dynamic environments, can
     complicate the problem.

4. **Scaling**:
   - Larger grids or higher-dimensional spaces significantly increase
     computational complexity.

## **Applications**

1. **Autonomous Robots**: Navigation for delivery robots, drones, or vacuum cleaners.
2. **Autonomous Vehicles**: Route planning for self-driving cars in environments
   with static obstacles.
3. **Warehouse Management**: Pathfinding for robots in warehouses with shelves
   as obstacles.
4. **Game AI**: Controlling characters or units to navigate maps efficiently.

## **Expected Output**

The output of the path-planning problem should be:

1. A **valid path** represented as a sequence of grid coordinates, e.g., `[(1,1),
(1,2), (2,2), ..., (5,5)]`.
2. A **visual representation** of the grid with the path marked, where:

   - `S` represents the start location.
   - `G` represents the goal location.
   - `*` represents the path.  
     Example:

   ```text
   S * 1 0 0
   0 * 1 0 0
   0 * * 1 0
   1 1 * 1 0
   0 0 * * G
   ```

3. If no path exists, the output should indicate that the goal is unreachable.

## **Goals of the Project**

This project aims to:

1. Formulate the robotics path-planning problem in a structured and
   computationally efficient manner.
2. Provide a robust framework to validate the feasibility of a path for a given grid.
3. Serve as a foundation for implementing advanced algorithms for path planning
   optimization, and real-world applications.
