### SAT CNF Model for Multi-Robot Path Planning

To model the problem as a SAT problem, we must encode it into a series of propositional variables and constraints expressed in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). Here's how we can achieve this systematically:

### Key Variables and Encodings

1. **Grid Representation**:
   Let $G(x, y, t)$ be a boolean variable that is **true** if a robot is at position $(x, y)$ at time $t$.

2. **Movement Actions**:
   For each robot $r$, define variables $M(r, dx, dy, t)$, where $(dx, dy)$ represents a movement direction at time $t$:
   - $dx, dy \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ (up, down, left, right, diagonal, or stationary).
   - $M(r, dx, dy, t)$ is **true** if robot $r$ moves by $(dx, dy)$ at time $t$.

3. **Collision Avoidance**:
   - No two robots can occupy the same cell at the same time.

4. **Start and Goal Conditions**:
   - Encode the initial position for each robot at $t = 0$.
   - Encode the goal condition for each robot at $t = T$.

5. **Time Horizon**:
   - $T$ is the maximum number of steps available to all robots.

### Constraints

#### 1. **Initial Position**
Each robot $r$ starts at its specified initial position at $t = 0$:
\[ G_r(x_{\text{start}}, y_{\text{start}}, 0) \]
For each robot $r$, set $G_r(x_{\text{start}}, y_{\text{start}}, 0)$ to **true** and all other positions to **false** at $t = 0$.

---

#### 2. **Goal Condition**
Each robot $r$ must reach its specified goal position by $t = T$:
\[ G_r(x_{\text{goal}}, y_{\text{goal}}, T) \]
Encode $G_r(x_{\text{goal}}, y_{\text{goal}}, T)$ to **true** and ensure all other positions are **false** at $t = T$.

---

#### 3. **Robot Movement**
At each time step $t$, a robot $r$ must:
   - Move to one of its neighboring cells or remain stationary.
   - Move only to free cells.
   - Satisfy grid boundaries.

**Encoding:**
- Transition constraints:
   If $G_r(x, y, t)$ is true, then the robot moves to one of its valid neighboring cells or stays stationary:
   \[
   G_r(x, y, t) \implies \bigvee_{(dx, dy)} M_r(dx, dy, t)
   \]
   If $M_r(dx, dy, t)$ is true, then the robot is in the destination cell $(x + dx, y + dy)$ at $t + 1$:
   \[
   M_r(dx, dy, t) \implies G_r(x + dx, y + dy, t + 1)
   \]

- Obstacles:
   Robots cannot enter obstacle cells. For all $t$:
   \[
   G_r(x, y, t) \implies \text{(free cell at } (x, y) \text{)}
   \]

---

#### 4. **Collision Avoidance**
Robots cannot occupy the same cell at the same time $t$:
For each pair of robots $r_1$ and $r_2$:
\[
G_{r_1}(x, y, t) \implies \neg G_{r_2}(x, y, t)
\]

---

#### 5. **No Path Crossing**
Robots cannot swap positions in a single time step. If $r_1$ moves from $(x_1, y_1)$ to $(x_2, y_2)$, then $r_2$ cannot move from $(x_2, y_2)$ to $(x_1, y_1)$:
\[
M_{r_1}(dx, dy, t) \wedge M_{r_2}(-dx, -dy, t) \implies \text{false}
\]

---

#### 6. **Time Progression**
Every robot must either move or stay stationary at each time step until $T$.

**Encoding:**
For each robot $r$:
\[
\bigvee_{(dx, dy)} M_r(dx, dy, t)
\]

---

### Final Encoding

Combine all the constraints to form the SAT problem:
- Encode grid boundaries.
- Encode robot start and goal conditions.
- Encode movement and collision constraints.
