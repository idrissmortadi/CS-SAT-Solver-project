Your project on **robot path planning using SAT solvers** already involves a strong formal reasoning component. From the **course slides on knowledge representation and reasoning**, an interesting addition could be **computational argumentation** to handle conflicting goals or unexpected events in the warehouse. 

### Possible Additions Inspired by the Course:
1. **Non-Monotonic Reasoning for Dynamic Updates**
   - Your path planning assumes static obstacles, but in a real warehouse, obstacles (e.g., other moving robots, new storage items) can appear dynamically.
   - **Non-monotonic reasoning** (from the slides) could allow the system to **recompute paths efficiently** when new information arrives rather than re-solving the entire SAT problem.

2. **Argumentation-Based Conflict Resolution**
   - When multiple robots need the same path or when conflicting constraints arise, argumentation frameworks (such as **Dungâ€™s abstract argumentation framework**) could be used to **reason about which plan is best**.
   - Example: If two robots want to use the same path, an argumentation-based system could weigh factors like **priority, urgency, and energy efficiency** to determine which robot should adjust its route.

3. **Belief Revision for Uncertain Information**
   - If sensors provide conflicting data (e.g., one sensor detects an obstacle, another does not), the system can use **belief revision** to decide whether to trust the information.
   - This could be modeled using a **default logic approach** or **probabilistic argumentation** to weigh different sources of information.
